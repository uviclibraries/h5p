## Creating a Game Map using H5P

1. In Wordpress, select my site in the upper toolbar, then on the left hand side select **H5P Content** and select **Add new**
2. Once add new is selected, a bunch of options will appear with a box including **Search for content types**.
3. In the search for content types box, type **Game map** and click on  **get**
4. Once you have done this you the get button should be replaced with a blue **details button**. Click that.
5. Then press use, you can also try the content demo, which is also linked [here](https://h5p.org/content-types/game-map#example=1463359)
