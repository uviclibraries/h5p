Before you start making your own interactive video, please watch this excellent example of an H5P video being used to **[teach a grade 2 science experiment virtually](https://brittanyseducblog.opened.ca/2020/10/03/science-demonstration-video){:target="_blank"}**.

1. Add a new video to and prepare to add interactive elements to it:
- Click on the **Interactive** button near the middle of the screen.
- Click on the **light grey plus** button under the “**Add a video**” text.
- Copy and paste a YouTube URL into the text box and click the **Insert** button. **-OR-**
- Click on the **Upload video file** button and upload your video to your blog.

  For example: use the following [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O-Mi43H9wM){:target="_blank"} or download the following [video](http://bit.ly/dsc-goat-video){:target="_blank"}
