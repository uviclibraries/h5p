# Interactive Videos on a WordPress Blog with H5P
In this exercise, you will practice capturing still shots of all or parts of your screen, annotating the screen captures and inserting the resulting image file into a blog post. If you have any questions or get stuck as you work through this, please ask your instructor for assistance.

Before you start making your own interactive video, please watch this excellent example of an H5P video being used to **[teach a grade 2 science experiment virtually](https://brittanyseducblog.opened.ca/2020/10/03/science-demonstration-video){:target="_blank"}**.

1. If you haven’t done so already, install the H5P plugin in your WordPress blog, or if you have a UVic student, please create an [OpenEd.ca blog](https://opened.ca/get-started/){:target="_blank"} for this exercise if you don’t already have one.

2. Enable the H5P plugin on your WordPress blog:
- In your blog administration control panel click on the **Plugins** button, on the left navigation bar, and then scroll down and find the H5P plugin, and press the **Activate button**.<br>

3. Navigate to the H5P plugin setting page & enable the Interactive video tool if necessary and add new H5P content:
- Mouse over the **H5P Content** button on the left navigation bar and then select the **Add New**.
- If this is your first time using H5P, click on the blue **I consent, give me the Hub!** button to enable the H5P features you will need to make your interactive video.<br>
