## Memory / Image Pairing ,Image Sequencing, Image Hotspots, Image Juxtaposition, Image Slider

### Memory Game and Image Pairing 
(The difference between memory and Image pairing is that the matching image of the image pair is typically not the same image, so instead of downloading 4 images you would have to download 8 and find themes for example we could have raspberries and strawberries matching as they are both berries and then have a red apple and  a green apple for instance). 
1. In Wordpress, select my site in the upper toolbar, then on the left hand side select **H5P Content** and select **Add new**
2. Once add new is selected, a bunch of options will appear with a box including **Search for content types**.
3. In the search for content types box, type **Memory** or **Image Pairing** and click on  **get** and **install**
4. Once you have done this you the get button should be replaced with a blue **use**. Click that.
5. Then press use.
6. It will now ask for a title, for this activity you can choose your own or follow along with our example. Type **Fruit**.
7. Next you will download the following images:
   - [strawberry](https://www.pexels.com/photo/red-and-orange-apple-fruit-102104/){:target="_blank"},
   - [apple](https://www.pexels.com/search/red%20apple/){:target="_blank"},
   - [cherries](https://www.pexels.com/photo/red-cherry-fruit-768009/){:target="_blank"} and
   - [raspberry](https://www.pexels.com/photo/wood-raspberries-sweet-fruit-179945/){:target="_blank"}
8. Next, you can add an image, by clicking the **+Add** button, lets start by adding the strawberry image that we downloaded in step 7. 
9.  You must also add an alternative text to make the activity accessible, ie label your fruit with their names. As an option, you can also add audio tracks.
10.  To try the audio feature out add the following URL: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gbngf_7w0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gbngf_7w0){:target="_blank"}
11.  In the same card, add the image a second time, since this will be a game of memory. So repeat steps 8-10.
12.  You can add a final description for once the 2 cards are found. For instance you could say. **Congrats you found the strawberry.**
13.  Next scroll back to the top and press on card 2 and repeat steps 8-12 but with the next photo, the apple. This time no need to add an audio track. 
14.  Finally select **Add new** card and repeat again for the cherries and raspberries.
15.  Once you are finished and have added all the memory cards, click the **Create** button on the top right hand side.   <iframe src="https://brittanyseducblog.opened.ca/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=h5p_embed&id=9" width="400" height="400" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" title="Fruit"></iframe><script src="https://brittanyseducblog.opened.ca/wp-content/plugins/h5p/h5p-php-library/js/h5p-resizer.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><br>

### Image Sequencing
Follow steps 1-5 under the Memory game activity but search for **Image Sequencing** instead.
1. Next title your project as **Sequencing Alphabetically**
2. For the task description, write **Drag to arrange the images in the correct alphabetical sequence**
3. For alternate task description, write **Make the following list be ordered correctly using alphabetical order. Use the cursor keys to navigate through the list items, use space to activate or deactivate an item and the cursor keys to move it**
4. We will stick to using the same four images you previously downloaded in the memory game step 7
5. Add new image and image description starting with the strawberry.
6. Then select card 2 and do the same as step 5 with the apple
7. Repeat on card 3 for the Cherries
8. Finally **add new image**, to add the Raspeberries
9. Now before completing, make sure to move the images in the correct order starting with Apple. Use the arrows to do this.
10. The order is as follows Apple, Cherries, Raspberries, Strawberry
11. Once you have done this,  click the **Create** button on the top right hand side.

### Image Hotspots 
Follow steps 1-5 under the Memory game activity but search for **Image hotspots** instead.
1. Title your project as **Fruit Smoothie**
2. Download the following [Image](https://www.pexels.com/photo/strawberry-smoothie-on-glass-jar-775032/){:target="_blank"}
3. Next, add that image as the **background image** by clicking the **+ Add** button. Find it in your downloads or wherever you saved the image.
4. You can add an alternative text such as **fruit recipe for smoothie**
5. Now you can elect the hotspot icon, we will use a **predefined icon**
6. For this workshop, I will use the predefined **info icon**.
7. My hotspot colour will be #1d3b99, but feel free to select your own by using the toggle.
8. **Hotspot**: Click on the bananas on the image. Sometimes you have to double click. 
9. Finally for the **Popup content**, select **text** from the toggle
10. Write **3 bananas**
11. Next we will **add hotspot** by clicking the blue bottom at the bottom
12. We will repeat step 8 but select the strawberries this time.
13. You will add a header of strawberries
14. Finally for the **Popup content**, select **video** from the toggle.

### Image Juxtaposition
Sample pre-processed images for making a Juxtapose are available on Flickr: an image of the [McPherson Library in 1963](https://www.flickr.com/photos/152721723@N08/40478805172/in/photostream/){:target="_blank"} and a [similar image from 2013](https://www.flickr.com/photos/152721723@N08/40478806912/){:target="_blank"}, and an image of the BC Parliament buildings [by day](https://www.flickr.com/photos/152721723@N08/39488549515/in/photostream/){:target="_blank"} and [by night](https://www.flickr.com/photos/152721723@N08/39674455174/){:target="_blank"}
