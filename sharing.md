## Add your interactive video to a blog post:
- Click on the **Posts** button on the left navigation bar.
- Click on the **Add New** button near the top left of the browser window.
- Type in a **Title** and **some text** in the body of the blog post and then press **enter** on your keyboard once.
- On a new line (or in a new block) past the short code from the last step on to the new line. The short code should loke something like this: <br><code>[h5p id="1"]</code>
- Click on the **Publish** or **Update** button on the right of your window, and then check your new interactive element on your blog post! **NOTE**: The H5P video will not preview like a regular YouTube video in edit mode, but will display properly when you view the public version of the web page.
